# DexScreener Integration Setup Guide

DexScreener is a powerful cryptocurrency trading analytics platform that provides real-time data for trading pairs across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Integrate DexScreener with SurfSense to search and analyze crypto market data using AI.

## How it works

The DexScreener connector fetches trading pair data for tokens you specify and indexes it into your SurfSense search space. This allows you to:

- Track real-time price movements across multiple DEXs
- Monitor trading volume and liquidity metrics
- Analyze historical price trends
- Search for specific tokens and trading pairs using natural language
- Get AI-powered insights on market data

## Authorization

**No authentication required!** DexScreener's API is public and free to use. Simply configure the tokens you want to track and start indexing.

## Supported Chains

The DexScreener connector supports the following blockchain networks:

- **Ethereum** - The largest DeFi ecosystem
- **BSC (Binance Smart Chain)** - High-speed, low-cost transactions
- **Polygon** - Ethereum scaling solution
- **Arbitrum** - Ethereum Layer 2 rollup
- **Optimism** - Ethereum Layer 2 optimistic rollup
- **Base** - Coinbase's Layer 2 network
- **Avalanche** - High-throughput blockchain platform
- **Solana** - High-performance blockchain

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add the Connector

1. Navigate to your SurfSense dashboard
2. Click **"Add Connector"** in the connector popup
3. Select **"DexScreener"** from the connector list

### 2. Configure Connector Name

Enter a friendly name for your connector (e.g., "My Crypto Tracker", "DeFi Portfolio Monitor")

### 3. Add Tokens to Track

For each token you want to monitor:

1. Click **"Add Token"**
2. Select the **blockchain network** from the dropdown
3. Enter the **token contract address** (must be a valid 40-character hex address starting with `0x`)
4. (Optional) Add a **friendly name** to help identify the token

**Example:**
- Chain: Ethereum
- Address: `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`
- Name: Wrapped Ether (WETH)

You can track up to **50 tokens** per connector.

### 4. Configure Indexing Settings

#### Date Range (Optional)
Set a date range to limit historical data indexing. Leave blank to index all available data.

#### Periodic Sync
Enable automatic re-indexing to keep your data up-to-date:

- **Every 5 minutes** - For active trading monitoring
- **Every 15 minutes** - For frequent updates
- **Every hour** - For regular monitoring
- **Every 6 hours** - For daily tracking
- **Every 12 hours** - For bi-daily updates
- **Daily** - For long-term portfolio tracking
- **Weekly** - For occasional updates

### 5. Connect

Click **"Connect"** to create the connector and start indexing.

## Token Configuration

### Finding Token Addresses

Token contract addresses can be found on:

- **DexScreener**: Search for the token and copy the address from the URL or token info
- **Etherscan** (Ethereum): etherscan.io
- **BscScan** (BSC): bscscan.com
- **PolygonScan** (Polygon): polygonscan.com
- **Block explorers** for other chains

### Address Format

Token addresses must be:
- Exactly 42 characters long
- Start with `0x`
- Followed by 40 hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)

**Valid example:** `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`  
**Invalid examples:**
- `C02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` (missing 0x)
- `0x123` (too short)
- `0xGGGGaaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` (invalid hex characters)

## What Gets Indexed

For each tracked token, the connector indexes:

- **Token Information**
  - Token symbol and name
  - Contract address
  - Blockchain network

- **Price Data**
  - Current price in USD
  - Price in native currency
  - Price change percentages (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h)

- **Volume Metrics**
  - 24-hour trading volume
  - 6-hour trading volume
  - 1-hour trading volume

- **Liquidity Information**
  - Total liquidity in USD
  - Liquidity distribution across DEXs

- **DEX Information**
  - Exchange names
  - Trading pair details
  - Pool addresses

## Managing Your Connector

### Editing Configuration

1. Click **"Configure"** on your DexScreener connector
2. Update the connector name if needed
3. Add or remove tokens from the tracked list
4. Modify token details (chain, address, name)
5. Click **"Save"** to apply changes

### Triggering Manual Indexing

To manually re-index your connector:

1. Open the connector configuration
2. Click **"Index Now"** or wait for the next scheduled sync

### Deleting the Connector

To remove the connector and all indexed data:

1. Click the **delete icon** on the connector card
2. Confirm the deletion

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid token address" error

**Cause:** The token address doesn't match the required format.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the address is exactly 42 characters (0x + 40 hex chars)
- Verify you copied the full address without spaces
- Check that the address contains only valid hex characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)

### "Token not found" error

**Cause:** The token doesn't exist on DexScreener or hasn't been indexed yet.

**Solution:**
- Verify the token address is correct
- Check that the token has trading activity on DEXs
- Try searching for the token on [dexscreener.com](https://dexscreener.com) first
- Ensure you selected the correct blockchain network

### No data appearing in search

**Cause:** Indexing may not have completed yet.

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes for the initial indexing to complete
- Check the connector status in your dashboard
- Verify the connector is active and not paused
- Try manually triggering a re-index

### "Maximum tokens exceeded" error

**Cause:** You're trying to add more than 50 tokens to a single connector.

**Solution:**
- Remove some tokens you no longer need to track
- Create a second DexScreener connector for additional tokens
- Prioritize the most important tokens for your use case

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 5-10 important tokens and expand as needed
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Add friendly names to tokens for easier identification
3. **Set Appropriate Sync Frequency**: Balance data freshness with API usage
4. **Organize by Strategy**: Create separate connectors for different trading strategies or portfolios
5. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove tokens you're no longer tracking to keep data relevant

## API Rate Limits

DexScreener's public API has rate limits. To avoid issues:

- Don't track more tokens than you actively need
- Use reasonable sync frequencies (avoid 5-minute intervals unless necessary)
- If you encounter rate limit errors, increase the sync interval

## Privacy & Security

- **No Authentication**: DexScreener connector doesn't require API keys or credentials
- **Public Data Only**: All indexed data is publicly available market data
- **No Personal Info**: Token addresses and market data don't contain personal information
- **Secure Storage**: All connector configurations are encrypted and stored securely
