## ✅ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### The Decision

# ✅ **CONDITIONAL GO**

**Proceed với AI-First MVP strategy**

### The Rationale

1. **Market is REAL:** $500M-800M SAM, 15% YoY growth
2. **Timing is FAVORABLE:** Bull run 2026, 6-12 month AI window
3. **Business model is STRONG:** LTV:CAC 40:1-150:1, 94-99% margin
4. **Differentiation is CLEAR:** AI-first positioning (white space)
5. **Solo founder is VIABLE:** No budget constraints, automation possible

### The Conditions

**MUST DO:**
1. **AI moat FIRST** - Build proprietary AI before features
2. **Speed is CRITICAL** - 6-12 month window to establish lead
3. **Focus on PMF** - 100 users with great AI > 1,000 users with mediocre AI
4. **Plan for scaling** - Automation + community (solo constraint)
5. **Bear market hedge** - Sticky features (survive downturn)

**MUST AVOID:**
1. Feature creep (don't build data aggregation tool)
2. Premature scaling (don't chase 1,000+ users Year 1)
3. Ignoring AI accuracy (if <60%, pivot immediately)
4. Solo hero syndrome (automate, outsource, build community)
5. Regulatory risk (disclaimers, legal review)

- Contingency: Remove predictions, keep alerts/tracking

### Success Criteria

**Year 1:**
- 100-500 paying users ✅
- $5K-25K MRR ✅
- 70%+ prediction accuracy ✅
- <25% churn ✅
- 4-7 month break-even ✅
